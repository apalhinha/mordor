# Walk to Mordor challenge

Repeat Sam and Frodo's walk from Bag End to Mordor.

Either walking, running, biking, or whatever...

# How it works
* Walk from Hobbiton to Mordor. In fact, walk wherever you want, and we will compare yours with Frodo's progress
* Walk, run, bike, swim, or use whatever method you want, as long as you can measure distance
* Track your progress in the (public) [Excel file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oGzBmn3m_w-tq_c_vNhARID2xahvLd302_oWQIMN0hs/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}
  * No constraints nor permissions to edit this file. Use gently, preserve content from others...
  * Use Km or Miles
  * Track up to 3 methods of moving (such as walk, run, bike)
* Include any comments, text, tips to others on each day's log. They appear your history log, in this site  
* Once in a while, we publish this site is updated, showing overall progress side by side with Frodo's progress

# How to join
Process is simple, just add "your space" in the [tracking Excel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oGzBmn3m_w-tq_c_vNhARID2xahvLd302_oWQIMN0hs/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}:
* Copy columns B, C, D, and E to the rightmost free column.
* In the top row of copied columns, adjust your nickname and preferred unit (Km vs Miles).
  * Use a nickname containing only letters, digits, minus '-', and underscore '_'.
  * Rational is that your nickname will be used as a file name in this site.
* Underneath your nickname, use 3 cells to designate what are you measuring
  * Choose any movement method (walk, run, bike, skate, treadmill, swim, whatever you want to use) as long as you can measure distance
  * Only 3 cells/columns are available for this: A script will publish the data and for that such rigid format is needed
* Type in your comments in the 4th column. They will appear in your history log.

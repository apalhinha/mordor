| Day | Miles | Total | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 1.0 | 29.0 | Road zig-zigs to top of a steep bank and goes down for the last time. Can see across Woody End to the River. They stop to rest, eat, and rest more! (ca. 1:30-4:30 p.m.) Sun was 'beginning to get low' as they went down the hill. |
| 2 | 3.0 | 32.0 | Road ahead runs fairly straight and level. Behind them it curves slightly. A Black Rider comes. Sam and Pippin hide in a hollow. Frodo behind tree by road (ca.5 p.m.). |
| 2 | 3.0 | 35.0 | Keep a stone's throw left of the road...slower going. |
| 2 | 2.0 | 37.0 | Road splits. Road to Stock bends left and goes down into the lowlands. They take a lane which branches to the right, winding through a wood of ancient Oaks. 'Sun down and evening coming on' (ca. 6:30 p.m.). Quite close to the road-meeting they creep inside a huge tree. Eat and rest. |
| 2 | 1.0 | 38.0 | Go on in twilight. Begin to sing. (ca. 7:00 p.m.) |
| 2 | 3.0 | 41.0 | 'And now to bed!' Pippin says, when Black Rider is heard again (ca. 9 p.m.). Elves arrive, Rider leaves, and Frodo & Co. continue with Elves. |

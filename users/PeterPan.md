| 2 | 1.0 | 46.0 | Camp - Woody End. A green floor in the wood, roofed by boughs of trees. To the east a steep shoulder falls, and they can overlook the river valley. The lights of the village of Woodhall seen below (ca. 11 p.m.). |
| 3 | 0.0 | 46.0 | Sleep late (leaving time ca. 11:00 a.m.). Frodo decides to cut SE to Buckleberry Ferry. Scramble down hill into the thick trees below. It begins to cloud up. |
|   | 1.0 | 47.0 | A deep-banked stream below the hill cuts across their path. Looking back, they see a Black Rider on the hillcrest where they had camped. They force through the bushes alongside the stream. |
|   | 1.0 | 48.0 | Pippin realizes it is the Stock-brook. The banks are low enough now for them to cross. The land on its south bank is wet and reedy. |
|   | 2.0 | 50.0 | They reach a belt of trees, mostly oaks with a few elms and ash. Drops of rain fall. |
|   | 2.0 | 52.0 | Pippin realizes they've turned too far south as they are still in the trees. |
|   | 2.0 | 54.0 | Still in the trees, they stop for lunch (ca. 2:00 p.m.). Their singing is cut by the cry of a Black Rider, and they leave (ca. 3:00 p.m.). |
|   | 1.0 | 55.0 | Wood ends. The land steadily becomes more tame. Sun is shining brightly. |
|   | 1.0 | 56.0 | Reach area of the Marish with fields, meadows, hedges, gates, and drainage dikes. |
|   | 5.0 | 61.0 | Edges of fields worked by Farmer Maggot. |

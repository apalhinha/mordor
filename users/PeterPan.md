# And Frodo?
From this point onward, the following happened to Frodo.
We are listing 9.31 km, the same distance as your personal record in a day.

| Day | Km | Total | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 4.83 | 70.81 | Wood more dense, and lane went lower, running in a fold of hills, with hazel on the slopes alongside. Pippin quickly becomes sleepy. |
|   | 1.61 | 72.42 | Turn right off the path on 'a green ride' through thickets. |
|   | 1.61 | 74.03 | Camp - Woody End. A green floor in the wood, roofed by boughs of trees. To the east a steep shoulder falls, and they can overlook the river valley. The lights of the village of Woodhall seen below (ca. 11 p.m.). |
| 3 | 0 | 74.03 | Sleep late (leaving time ca. 11:00 a.m.). Frodo decides to cut SE to Buckleberry Ferry. Scramble down hill into the thick trees below. It begins to cloud up. |
|   | 1.61 | 75.64 | A deep-banked stream below the hill cuts across their path. Looking back, they see a Black Rider on the hillcrest where they had camped. They force through the bushes alongside the stream. |
|   | 1.61 | 77.25 | Pippin realizes it is the Stock-brook. The banks are low enough now for them to cross. The land on its south bank is wet and reedy. |

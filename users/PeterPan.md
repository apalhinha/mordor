# And Frodo?
From this point onward, the following happened to Frodo.
We are listing 7.9Km, the same distance as your personal record in a day.

| Day | Km | Total | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 16.1 | 45.1 | Road rolls up and down. |
|   | 1.6 | 46.7 | Road zig-zigs to top of a steep bank and goes down for the last time. Can see across Woody End to the River. They stop to rest, eat, and rest more! (ca. 1:30-4:30 p.m.) Sun was 'beginning to get low' as they went down the hill. |
|   | 4.8 | 51.5 | Road ahead runs fairly straight and level. Behind them it curves slightly. A Black Rider comes. Sam and Pippin hide in a hollow. Frodo behind tree by road (ca.5 p.m.). |

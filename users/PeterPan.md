From this point, the following happened to Frodo:

| 2 | 4.8 | Keep a stone‚Äôs throw left of the road...slower going. |
| 2 | 3.2 | Road splits. Road to Stock bends left and goes down into the lowlands. They take a lane which branches to the right, winding through a wood of ancient Oaks. ‚ÄúSun down and evening coming on‚Äù (ca. 6:30 p.m.). Quite close to the road-meeting they creep inside a huge tree. Eat and rest. |

| 3 | 1.6 | Pippin realizes it is the Stock-brook. The banks are low enough now for them to cross. The land on its south bank is wet and reedy. |

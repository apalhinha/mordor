# And Frodo?
From this point, the following happened to Frodo:

| Day | Miles | Total | Notes || --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 1.0 | 29.0 | Road zig-zigs to top of a steep bank and goes down for the last time. Can see across Woody End to the River. They stop to rest, eat, and rest more! (ca. 1:30-4:30 p.m.) Sun was 'beginning to get low' as they went down the hill. |
| 2 | 3.0 | 32.0 | Road ahead runs fairly straight and level. Behind them it curves slightly. A Black Rider comes. Sam and Pippin hide in a hollow. Frodo behind tree by road (ca.5 p.m.). |
| 2 | 3.0 | 35.0 | Keep a stone's throw left of the road...slower going. |
| 2 | 2.0 | 37.0 | Road splits. Road to Stock bends left and goes down into the lowlands. They take a lane which branches to the right, winding through a wood of ancient Oaks. 'Sun down and evening coming on' (ca. 6:30 p.m.). Quite close to the road-meeting they creep inside a huge tree. Eat and rest. |
| 2 | 1.0 | 38.0 | Go on in twilight. Begin to sing. (ca. 7:00 p.m.) |
| 2 | 3.0 | 41.0 | 'And now to bed!' Pippin says, when Black Rider is heard again (ca. 9 p.m.). Elves arrive, Rider leaves, and Frodo & Co. continue with Elves. |
| 2 | 3.0 | 44.0 | Wood more dense, and lane went lower, running in a fold of hills, with hazel on the slopes alongside. Pippin quickly becomes sleepy. |
| 2 | 1.0 | 45.0 | Turn right off the path on 'a green ride' through thickets. |
| 2 | 1.0 | 46.0 | Camp - Woody End. A green floor in the wood, roofed by boughs of trees. To the east a steep shoulder falls, and they can overlook the river valley. The lights of the village of Woodhall seen below (ca. 11 p.m.). |
| 3 | 0.0 | 46.0 | Sleep late (leaving time ca. 11:00 a.m.). Frodo decides to cut SE to Buckleberry Ferry. Scramble down hill into the thick trees below. It begins to cloud up. |
| 3 | 1.0 | 47.0 | A deep-banked stream below the hill cuts across their path. Looking back, they see a Black Rider on the hillcrest where they had camped. They force through the bushes alongside the stream. |
| 3 | 1.0 | 48.0 | Pippin realizes it is the Stock-brook. The banks are low enough now for them to cross. The land on its south bank is wet and reedy. |
| 3 | 2.0 | 50.0 | They reach a belt of trees, mostly oaks with a few elms and ash. Drops of rain fall. |
| 3 | 2.0 | 52.0 | Pippin realizes they've turned too far south as they are still in the trees. |
| 3 | 2.0 | 54.0 | Still in the trees, they stop for lunch (ca. 2:00 p.m.). Their singing is cut by the cry of a Black Rider, and they leave (ca. 3:00 p.m.). |
| 3 | 1.0 | 55.0 | Wood ends. The land steadily becomes more tame. Sun is shining brightly. |
| 3 | 1.0 | 56.0 | Reach area of the Marish with fields, meadows, hedges, gates, and drainage dikes. |
| 3 | 5.0 | 61.0 | Edges of fields worked by Farmer Maggot. |
| 3 | 1.0 | 62.0 | After a turnip field there is a stout gate to a rutted lane, edged by hedges.     |
| 3 | 1.0 | 63.0 | Farmer Maggota's house and buildings: brick with thatched roofs, surrounded by a high wall cut by a wooden gate from the lane. Eat. (Est. time there: 5:30 - 7:00 p.m.: full dark when they leave). |
| 3 | 2.0 | 65.0 | Farmer Maggota's lane meets the Causeway to Buckleberry Ferry. Ride in wagon. |
| 3 | 5.0 | 70.0 | Boggy land all around. Foggy. Merry meets them at the Ferry landing. As they reach the other side of the river, they can see a Black Rider on the west shore. |
| 3 | 0.5 | 70.5 | Taking the main road north from the Ferry, Buck Hill is on the left and Buckleberry on the right. They take a lane to the right, and climb up and down into the country. |
| 3 | 2.5 | 73.0 | Crickhollow - spend the night. 'A Conspiracy Unmasked'. |
| 4 | 0.0 | 73.0 | Leave Crickhollow soon after 6:00 a.m. Foggy. Ride ponies slowly. |
| 4 | 3.0 | 76.0 | Enter tunnel under Hedge to reach The Old Forest. Path disappears (ca. 7:15 a.m.). |
| 4 | 2.0 | 78.0 | The Bonfire Glade - clear path beyond. Sunny, but not yet in clearing (ca. 8 a.m.). |
| 4 | 8.0 | 86.0 | On path in the Forest. Path climbs gently. |
| 4 | 1.0 | 87.0 | Top of knoll in Forest. Hazy. Surrounded by Trees. Eat, rest (11 a.m.-ca.1 p.m.) |
| 4 | 1.0 | 88.0 | Path veers SE. Company leaves path and tries to turn north. |
| 4 | 2.0 | 90.0 | Cross series of deep folds running SE. Keep turning east. Lose direction. |
| 4 | 1.0 | 91.0 | Enter fold too deep to leave. Follow it SE to Withywindle (ca. 4 p.m.). |
| 4 | 2.0 | 93.0 | Merry finds path along bank of the River. Follow it east through wetlands. |
| 4 | 2.0 | 95.0 | Stop by Old Man Willow to rest. (ca. 5:30) Rescued by Tom Bombadil (ca.6:00 p.m.). |
| 4 | 3.0 | 98.0 | Reach Tom Bombadil's house. Stars are out (ca. 7 p.m.). |
| 5 | 0.0 | 98.0 | Rainy. Spend the day at Tom Bombadil's house. |
| 6 | 0.0 | 98.0 | Leave Tom's house and climb zig-zag path to brow of hill on west side of Barrow-downs (ca. 9 a.m.). On ponies go up steep slopes and down long limbs. No trees or water. Turn more east than they intend and enter the Barrow-downs, a place of great dread: inhabited by evil Barrow-wights from Angmar (R. Foster). |
| 6 | 14.0 | 112.0 | Midday. Stop in a hollow atop a hill. Eat and fall asleep. Wake in fog, sun sinking. |

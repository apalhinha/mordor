# And Frodo?
From this point, the following happened to Frodo:

| Day | Miles | Total | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 1.0 | 29.0 | Road zig-zigs to top of a steep bank and goes down for the last time. Can see across Woody End to the River. They stop to rest, eat, and rest more! (ca. 1:30-4:30 p.m.) Sun was 'beginning to get low' as they went down the hill. |
| 2 | 3.0 | 32.0 | Road ahead runs fairly straight and level. Behind them it curves slightly. A Black Rider comes. Sam and Pippin hide in a hollow. Frodo behind tree by road (ca.5 p.m.). |
| 2 | 3.0 | 35.0 | Keep a stone's throw left of the road...slower going. |
| 2 | 2.0 | 37.0 | Road splits. Road to Stock bends left and goes down into the lowlands. They take a lane which branches to the right, winding through a wood of ancient Oaks. 'Sun down and evening coming on' (ca. 6:30 p.m.). Quite close to the road-meeting they creep inside a huge tree. Eat and rest. |
| 2 | 1.0 | 38.0 | Go on in twilight. Begin to sing. (ca. 7:00 p.m.) |
| 2 | 3.0 | 41.0 | 'And now to bed!' Pippin says, when Black Rider is heard again (ca. 9 p.m.). Elves arrive, Rider leaves, and Frodo & Co. continue with Elves. |
| 2 | 3.0 | 44.0 | Wood more dense, and lane went lower, running in a fold of hills, with hazel on the slopes alongside. Pippin quickly becomes sleepy. |
| 2 | 1.0 | 45.0 | Turn right off the path on 'a green ride' through thickets. |
| 2 | 1.0 | 46.0 | Camp - Woody End. A green floor in the wood, roofed by boughs of trees. To the east a steep shoulder falls, and they can overlook the river valley. The lights of the village of Woodhall seen below (ca. 11 p.m.). |
| 3 | 0.0 | 46.0 | Sleep late (leaving time ca. 11:00 a.m.). Frodo decides to cut SE to Buckleberry Ferry. Scramble down hill into the thick trees below. It begins to cloud up. |
| 3 | 1.0 | 47.0 | A deep-banked stream below the hill cuts across their path. Looking back, they see a Black Rider on the hillcrest where they had camped. They force through the bushes alongside the stream. |
| 3 | 1.0 | 48.0 | Pippin realizes it is the Stock-brook. The banks are low enough now for them to cross. The land on its south bank is wet and reedy. |

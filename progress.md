| 156 | 0.4 | Paddle past the south end of Tol Brandir. |
| 156 | 0.4 | Reach shelving shore on the south slopes of Amon Lhaw. Hide boat. |
| 156 | 0.8 | Head SE into the 'strange twisted knot of hills' - the eastern Emyn Muil. |
| 156 | 1.6 | Reach south edge of the hills: 'a sheer, high, impassible cliff overlooking the marshland of Nindalf 'the Wetwang', which lies East of the Anduin all along the delta of the Entwash. |
| 156 | 1.6 | Turn north away from the cliff. |
| 156 | 3.2 | Wind around a ravine. |
| 156 | 4.8 | Reach steep east face of inner hills. Climb down. |
| 156 | 3.2 | Camp about dusk. Hide behind boulders just back from the south-facing cliff. See glow of Gollum's eyes. |

| 157 | 6.4 | Climb into a gully and out. Forced to turn more to the north. |
| 157 | 9.7 | Keep as close to the cliff as can, angling southeast. Stop to eat. |
| 157 | 6.4 | Cliff curves more to the east. |
| 157 | 3.2 | Enter another ravine. Cliff still too high to descend. |
| 157 | 6.4 | Climb into another ravine. Camp at dusk. |

| 158 | 4.8 | Zig-zag into ravine. The south edge of the Dead Marshes appear east of the tumbled lands below. |
| 158 | 6.4 | Get lost in ravine. Realize they are 'going in circles.' Runoff from the ravine goes to the marshes. |
| 158 | 4.8 | Climb down to the bottom of another ravine. Cliff still too steep and high. Look out toward Mordor. Can smell the Dead Marshes. Go further back. Camp in a stony hollow surrounded by 'great jagged pinnacles of weathered rock.' Cold. |

| 159 | 3.2 | Go close to the cliff, in hopes of seeing a way down. |
| 159 | 1.6 | Must swing far back, then east again. Stop to listen for signs of Gollum. |
| 159 | 1.6 | Return to cliff-top, but rough 'scored and weathered rock' forces them away. |
| 159 | 6.4 | Cliff face is now lower, but they do not notice as they are not by the edge. Scramble into a deep cleft and out again. |
| 159 | 4.8 | Stop briefly. Eat. |
| 159 | 3.2 | Another cleft. |
| 159 | 6.4 | Still scrambling along back from the ridge. |
| 159 | 4.8 | Reach the deepest ravine thus far - a rock fault. Far wall is 'many fathoms high.' Frodo climbs down. Finds a few gnarled trees, mainly firs, but only for about 50 yards. Stumps continue to cliff edge. As cliff is lower, Frodo decides they should descend: the rock has 'slipped and cracked.' Storm arrives just as Frodo starts down. He slithers down to a rock ledge below. Sam remembers his rope and pulls Frodo up. After the storm they use the rope to descend. Dusk falls. |
| 159 | 1.6 | Head east from base of cliff, picking their way through wet boulders. |
| 159 | 3.2 | Reach a great fissure with a stream inside. It curves north: bars way. |
| 159 | 1.6 | Head back toward cliff, angling south. Too difficult to go far. No spot to hide. Stop next to a boulder. See Gollum crawling down cliff. Capture Gollum (ca. 8 p.m.). STOP, but have no rest while they watch Gollum. Late night, Frodo extracts pledge, then releases Gollum. |
| 159 | 1.6 | Start again ca. 2 a.m. Gollum leads them back north. |
| 159 | 4.8 | Reach the rift they had seen before, but farther north where sides are lower. Climb down into it (15 feet deep). Follow it south beside a 'shallow stony stream'. Gollum recites 'Fish' riddle. |

| 160 | 3.2 | Banks reduced to mossy mounds. |
| 160 | 3.2 | Stream gurgles over a stone shelf into the bog. Dry reeds all around. Mists rise above the Dead Marshes just ahead and on both sides. See Mountains of Mordor far ahead: wreathed in fog, lit by dawn. Rest briefly. |
| 160 | 3.2 | Gollum's path winds through the mists, turning to find the way between 'pools, and soft mires.' No birds. |
| 160 | 8.0 | As mists rise (ca. 10 a.m.), they stop for day in a reed-thicket (M. 1). |
| 161 | 0.0 | Late afternoon. Continue on. |
| 161 | 4.8 | Enter the heart of the Dead Marshes. |
| 161 | 4.8 | Round the west end of a wide stagnant mere. Air is 'black and heavy to breathe.' |
| 161 | 3.2 | Wisps of lights begin to appear: 'candles of corpses.' Another wide mere extends west from there. |

| 161 | 1.6 | They almost crawl as they founder through the treacherous mire. |
| 161 | 1.6 | Reach firmer ground (ca. 4 a.m.). Gollum trots down 'a long lane between high reeds,' then stops and sniffs. |
| 161 | 1.6 | Gollum's uneasiness grows. Hear cry of Nazgul. Rush of wind: lights go out. Moon peaks through clouds. See Nazgul. Gollum cowers and refuses to go on until moon is low. |
| 161 | 4.8 | Dawn. End of the marshes. Clear and cold. Mountains tower ahead across wastelands. Hide 'under a black stone' during gray day (M. 2). |

| 163 | 3.2 | Descend a steeper hill face. |
| 163 | 6.4 | Land rises in another long slow climbing slope. |
| 163 | 4.8 | Still on the moors. |

| 164 | 0.0 | On waking, Sam hears Smeagol/Gollum's debate. Sam wonders who 'she' is (=Shelob). At dusk, creep slowly forward. |
| 164 | 3.2 | Nazgul passes over. Pause for a while. |

| 167 | 1.6 | Frodo and Sam are blindfolded and led down a steep path, then up to Henneth Annun. Sunset gleams through the waterfall. |

| 169 | 9.7 | Dusk. End of the forest. Can see White Mountains to the west and dark peaks of the Ephel Duath to the east. A vale falls away before them - the Morgul. Gollum wants to continue, but they stop until midnight. Perched in an oak, the hobbits cannot sleep. |

| 170 | 0.0 | No dawn. Day grows even darker as time passes. Gollum wakes them (ca. 4 p.m.): 'No time to lose.' Leads them down the hillside. |
| 170 | 3.2 | Turn south across a long broken slope. |
| 170 | 1.6 | Turn east and reach the Southward Road. Follow the road into a great ring of trees to the Cross-roads. The setting sun lights the fallen head of the statue of a King of Gondor. |

| 170 | 1.6 | At the top of a 'flatiron' the road cuts through the steep-faced drop and curves sharply south around a 'great shoulder of rock.' |
| 170 | 1.6 | Road curves east again, next to the ravine of the Morgulduin. Way slants up steeply. Frodo glances across the vale and sees Minas Morgul. |
| 170 | 0.8 | Come to the white bridge. The road crosses it and winds up to the city gates. All is rotten, cold. Frodo totters forward as if to cross the bridge, but Sam stops him. Gollum leads them back across the road to a gap in the stone wall - a path along the slopes north of the river. |
| 170 | 1.6 | On a high shelf overlooking the city Frodo stops. The Morgul-host marches forth. |
| 170 | 0.8 | Continue up path a short way. Reach bottom of the Straight Stair. Stair is cut into the cliff with walls on each side, steps narrow, uneven, and steep as a ladder. |

| 175 | 0.0 | Frodo and Sam reach gate of the Tower ca. 5 a.m. Watchers send up signal of their escape. Run. Road curves out of sight from the gate. |
| 175 | 1.6 | Road curves down sharply to meet the Morgul-road. At the bridge just beyond the road meeting, they jump. Land just a few feet below in a thorn thicket. Dawn - but dark in the valley. |
| 175 | 1.6 | Climb down to bottom of north-running valley. |
| 175 | 1.6 | Halt briefly. Sam falls asleep. Turn north in the ravine. Frodo discards chain mail. Sam wishes for light and water. |

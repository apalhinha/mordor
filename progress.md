| 159 | 6.4 | 2214.5 | Still scrambling along back from the ridge. |

Stumps continue to cliff edge. As cliff is lower, Frodo decides they should descend: the rock has 'slipped and cracked.' Storm arrives just as Frodo starts down. He slithers down to a rock ledge below. Sam remembers his rope and pulls Frodo up. After the storm they use the rope to descend. Dusk falls. |
| 159 | 1.6 | 2220.9 | Head east from base of cliff, picking their way through wet boulders. |
| 159 | 3.2 | 2224.1 | Reach a great fissure with a stream inside. It curves north: bars way. |
| 159 | 1.6 | 2225.7 | Head back toward cliff, angling south. Too difficult to go far. No spot to hide. Stop next to a boulder. See Gollum crawling down cliff. Capture Gollum (ca. 8 p.m.). STOP, but have no rest while they watch Gollum. Late night, Frodo extracts pledge, then releases Gollum. |

| 159 | 4.8 | 2232.2 | Reach the rift they had seen before, but farther north where sides are lower. Climb down into it (15 feet deep). Follow it south beside a 'shallow stony stream'. Gollum recites 'Fish' riddle. |

| 160 | 3.2 | 2267.6 | Banks reduced to mossy mounds. |
| 160 | 3.2 | 2270.8 | Stream gurgles over a stone shelf into the bog. Dry reeds all around. Mists rise above the Dead Marshes just ahead and on both sides. See Mountains of Mordor far ahead: wreathed in fog, lit by dawn. Rest briefly. |
| 160 | 3.2 | 2274.0 | Gollum's path winds through the mists, turning to find the way between 'pools, and soft mires.' No birds. |
| 160 | 8.0 | 2282.0 | As mists rise (ca. 10 a.m.), they stop for day in a reed-thicket (M. 1). |
| 161 | 0.0 | 2282.0 | Late afternoon. Continue on. |
| 161 | 4.8 | 2286.9 | Enter the heart of the Dead Marshes. |
| 161 | 4.8 | 2291.7 | Round the west end of a wide stagnant mere. Air is 'black and heavy to breathe.' |
| 161 | 3.2 | 2294.9 | Wisps of lights begin to appear: 'candles of corpses.' Another wide mere extends west from there. |
| 161 | 1.6 | 2296.5 | Sam falls, sees dead faces in the water (from Battle of the Last Alliance). |
| 161 | 1.6 | 2298.1 | They almost crawl as they founder through the treacherous mire. |
| 161 | 1.6 | 2299.8 | Reach firmer ground (ca. 4 a.m.). Gollum trots down 'a long lane between high reeds,' then stops and sniffs. |
| 161 | 1.6 | 2301.4 | Gollum's uneasiness grows. Hear cry of Nazgul. Rush of wind: lights go out. Moon peaks through clouds. See Nazgul. Gollum cowers and refuses to go on until moon is low. |
| 161 | 4.8 | 2306.2 | Dawn. End of the marshes. Clear and cold. Mountains tower ahead across wastelands. Hide 'under a black stone' during gray day (M. 2). |

| 163 | 3.2 | 2336.8 | Descend a steeper hill face. |
| 163 | 6.4 | 2343.2 | Land rises in another long slow climbing slope. |
| 163 | 4.8 | 2348.0 | Still on the moors. |
| 163 | 4.8 | 2352.9 | Descend a last hill face. Reach the Desolation of the Morannon: gasping pools, mounds of slag. Stop at first slag-heap, but fumes drive them away. Crawl into a 'wide, almost circular pit, high-banked on the west.' An oily ooze fills bottom. Stay there (M. 4). |
| 164 | 0.0 | 2352.9 | On waking, Sam hears Smeagol/Gollum's debate. Sam wonders who 'she' is (=Shelob). At dusk, creep slowly forward. |
| 164 | 3.2 | 2356.1 | Nazgul passes over. Pause for a while. |
| 164 | 6.4 | 2362.5 | Midnight. Nazgul flies over again, but high up (on way to Isengard). Terrified, Gollum refuses to go on until ordered by Frodo. |
| 164 | 9.7 | 2372.2 | Dawn. Can see guards on the wall above the Black Gate. Hide in a hollow 'delved in the side of a low hill.' See Army of Easterlings arrive, then later, an army of Southrons.

| 165 | 0.0 | 2372.2 | Dusk. Creep out west side of hollow. |
| 165 | 3.2 | 2375.4 | Walk SW, west of the road. Road runs in a trenchlike valley between the mountains and the moors. It is newly repaired for many miles. |
| 165 | 11.3 | 2386.7 | End of the slag heaps. Brief rest. Midnight: Moon rises, almost full. |
| 165 | 11.3 | 2397.9 | Can still see the red light in one of the Towers of the Teeth. |
| 165 | 9.7 | 2407.6 | Finally turn south enough to hide the light from the Tower. |
| 165 | 3.2 | 2410.8 | Dawn. Reach northern edge of Ithilien. East across road are dark trees. Closer 'a tumbled heathland' with 'knots of pine-trees.' Air is fresh and fragrant. Hide in heather during day (M. 6). |

| 167 | 0.0 | 2449.4 | Noon. Rangers battle the Haradrim. Sam sees an oliphaunt. Sleep to late afternoon. Faramir questions Frodo, then leads them west. |
| 167 | 1.6 | 2451.0 | Cross stream below the pool. |
| 167 | 4.8 | 2455.9 | Descend steep slope. Faramir and Frodo talk as they go. |
| 167 | 3.2 | 2459.1 | Thread their way through woodland. |
| 167 | 4.8 | 2463.9 | Trees grow thinner. Turn right and 'come to a small river in a narrow gorge' - the same as that from the pool. |
| 167 | 1.6 | 2465.5 | Frodo and Sam are blindfolded and led down a steep path, then up to Henneth Annun. Sunset gleams through the waterfall. |
| 168 | 0.0 | 2465.5 | Moonset. Gollum fishes in waterfall pool. With Frodo's help, Faramir captures and questions Gollum. Rest a short time more while supplies are prepared. Leave ca. 8 a.m. Rangers lead them south, blindfolded. |

| 169 | 0.0 | 2500.9 | Leave at first light. |
| 169 | 12.9 | 2513.8 | Thicker trees. Brief rest. Air growing heavy. Gollum urges more speed. |
| 169 | 9.7 | 2523.5 | Cross a small stream. |
| 169 | 3.2 | 2526.7 | Reach area of large trees - more open: ash and oak. Gollum fearful. |
| 169 | 9.7 | 2536.3 | Dusk. End of the forest. Can see White Mountains to the west and dark peaks of the Ephel Duath to the east. A vale falls away before them - the Morgul. Gollum wants to continue, but they stop until midnight. Perched in an oak, the hobbits cannot sleep. |
| 170 | 0.0 | 2536.3 | Just past midnight, head east. Land slopes up steeply. Thickets and brambles. |
| 170 | 3.2 | 2539.5 | Cross a deep cleft. |

| 170 | 3.2 | 2546.0 | Go down a bit, but then up on a longer, steeper slope. |
| 170 | 3.2 | 2549.2 | Halt briefly. Can see tops of trees behind. Darkness begins to spread. |
| 170 | 3.2 | 2552.4 | Climb a great 'hogback' - climb the steep backslope, covered with spiny thickets. Descend the even steeper cliff face. Part way down, crawl into a 'hollow hall' formed by a 'tangled knot of thorns.' Sleep. |
| 170 | 0.0 | 2552.4 | No dawn. Day grows even darker as time passes. Gollum wakes them (ca. 4 p.m.): 'No time to lose.' Leads them down the hillside. |
| 170 | 3.2 | 2555.6 | Turn south across a long broken slope. |
| 170 | 1.6 | 2557.2 | Turn east and reach the Southward Road. Follow the road into a great ring of trees to the Cross-roads. The setting sun lights the fallen head of the statue of a King of Gondor. |
| 170 | 1.6 | 2558.9 | Pass east out of the trees, following the Morgul-road. Road climbs steeply, but is straight. |
| 170 | 1.6 | 2560.5 | At the top of a 'flatiron' the road cuts through the steep-faced drop and curves sharply south around a 'great shoulder of rock.' |
| 170 | 1.6 | 2562.1 | Road curves east again, next to the ravine of the Morgulduin. Way slants up steeply. Frodo glances across the vale and sees Minas Morgul. |
| 170 | 0.8 | 2562.9 | Come to the white bridge. The road crosses it and winds up to the city gates. All is rotten, cold. Frodo totters forward as if to cross the bridge, but Sam stops him. Gollum leads them back across the road to a gap in the stone wall - a path along the slopes north of the river. |
| 170 | 1.6 | 2564.5 | On a high shelf overlooking the city Frodo stops. The Morgul-host marches forth. |
| 170 | 0.8 | 2565.3 | Continue up path a short way. Reach bottom of the Straight Stair. Stair is cut into the cliff with walls on each side, steps narrow, uneven, and steep as a ladder. |
| 170 | 0.8 | 2566.1 | Above the stair, the cutting continues with a winding path - still climbing, but needs no steps: 'seemed to go on for miles.' |
| 170 | 2.4 | 2568.5 | Reach a wide shelf - cliff on left, chasm on right. No longer climbing. Ground is broken. |
| 170 | 2.4 | 2570.9 | Reach bottom of the Winding Stair. Stair zig-zigs up the sloping cliff. Even looks down on wraith-road at one point. |
| 170 | 0.8 | 2571.7 | Reach the top of the stairs. See red light through window in top of the Tower 'a long way off.' Sleep there between two great piers of rock. All around are 'jagged pinnacles...crevices and fissures.' |
| 172 | 0.0 | 2571.7 | 'Day.' Sam wakes and sees Gollum 'pawing at' Frodo. 'Sneak' conversation. Gollum leads them 'up a long ravine between piers and columns of torn and weathered rocks.' |
| 172 | 1.6 | 2573.3 | Opening to Shelob's Lair. Tunnel is so high and wide that Frodo and Sam can't touch hands as they feel their way along each wall. Tunnel climbs slowly. |
| 172 | 1.6 | 2575.0 | Sam feels an opening on the right. |
| 172 | 1.6 | 2576.6 | Sam feels an opening on the right. |
| 172 | 1.6 | 2578.2 | Frodo feels an opening on the left. |
| 172 | 1.6 | 2579.8 | Frodo and Sam's senses become numb, but feel things hanging down. |
| 172 | 1.6 | 2581.4 | Sam leaves right wall and holds on to Frodo. |
| 172 | 10.5 | 2591.8 | Frodo finds opening to main pit on left. |

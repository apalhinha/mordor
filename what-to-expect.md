# What to expect

Based on your current distance, we will share what you should expect in the next Km/Miles.
Your record in the Excel specifies whether you prefer Km or Miles.

This is what you should expect in the first 7.5 Miles:

| Day | Journey | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 | Leave Bag End at full dark (ca. 7 p.m.). Go around (W) end, jump hedge. |
| 1 | 1 | Go through gate into a lane. Head west. |
| 1 | 1 | Leave lane, follow hedgerows south. |
| 1 | 1 | Cross The Water on a plank bridge |
| 1 | 2 | Cross The Great Road from the Brandywine Bridge. Enter Tookland. |
| 1 | 2.5 | Look back at lights of Hobbiton from first slopes of the Green Hill Country. |

In case you are using Km, after doing 288Km, you would see:

Process is simple:

* Starting in the first available/free column, configure as shown in the picture

Done. As simple as that.

You can now start registering your progress.
Visit xyz to see how you score amongst others.

Some notes:
* Use a nickname containing only letters, digits, minus '-', and underscore '_'.
  * Rational is that your nickname will be used as a file name in this site.
* Your journey log will make much more sense if you use comments. Specially some time after.

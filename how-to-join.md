# How to join
Process is simple:
* Open the [tracking Excel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oGzBmn3m_w-tq_c_vNhARID2xahvLd302_oWQIMN0hs/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}:
* Starting in the first available/free column, configure as shown in the picture

Done. As simple as that.

You can now start registering your progress.
Visit xyz to see how you score amongst others.

Keep in mind the system is not online. Once in a while the Excel data will be convered into this.

Some notes:
* In the top row of copied columns, adjust your nickname and preferred unit (Km vs Miles).
  * Use a nickname containing only letters, digits, minus '-', and underscore '_'.
  * Rational is that your nickname will be used as a file name in this site.
* System is not __that__ smart
* Underneath your nickname, use 3 cells to designate what are you measuring
  * Choose any movement method (walk, run, bike, skate, treadmill, swim, whatever you want to use) as long as you can measure distance
  * Only 3 cells/columns are available for this: A script will publish the data and for that such rigid format is needed
* Type in your comments in the 4th column. They will appear in your history log.
